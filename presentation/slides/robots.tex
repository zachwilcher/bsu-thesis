\begin{frame}{Robots on a factory floor}
\(\Conf_n(\Gamma)\) can be used to model the paths of \(n\) robots moving along a factory floor.

By understanding the topology of \(Conf_n(\Gamma)\), we can better plan collision-free paths.
Specifically, by specifying a vector field which is repulsive along the removed diagonal,
a safe global control scheme can be constructed ().

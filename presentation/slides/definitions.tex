\begin{frame}{Definition of \(\Conf_n(\Gamma)\)}
    Graph configuration spaces were first studied by Aaron Abrams in his PhD thesis in 2000.

    \begin{definition}
        Given a graph \(\Gamma\), a point in the \(n\) point ordered configuration space of \(\Gamma\) denoted \(\Conf_n(\Gamma)\)
    is the positions of \(n\) \textit{distinct} particles placed on \(\Gamma\) such that no two particles occupy the same spot.
    \end{definition}

    Equivalently, \(\Conf_n(\Gamma) = \Gamma^n - \Delta\) where 
    \(\Delta\) is the pairwise diagonal \(\{(x_1, \cdots, x_n) \in \Gamma^n \mid x_i = x_j \text{ for some } i \neq j\}\).

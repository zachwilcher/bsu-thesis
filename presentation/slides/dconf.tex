\begin{frame}{The Discretized Configuration Space}
    \begin{definition}
        Given a graph \(\Gamma\), a point in the \(n\) point ordered \textit{discretized} configuration space of \(\Gamma\) denoted \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\)
    is the positions of \(n\) \textit{distinct} particles placed on \(\Gamma\) such that
    no two particles occupy the same vertex or the same edge.
    \end{definition}

    Equivalently, \(\DConf_n(\Gamma) = \Gamma^n - \Delta^{\square}\) 
    where \(\Delta^{\square}\) 
    is the ``thick'' diagonal
    \(\{(x_1, \cdots, x_n) \in \Gamma^n \mid x_i \text{ and } x_j \text{ share a cell for some } i \neq j \}\).

    \begin{theorem}
        If \(\Gamma\) is sufficiently subdivided, then \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) is homotopy equivalent to \(\Conf_n(\Gamma)\)
    \cite{PRUE2014136}.

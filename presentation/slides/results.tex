    \begin{prop}
    If \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) were a connected \(m\)-manifold without boundary,
    then \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) would have to be exactly one of the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\DConf_{m}(K_{2m+1}) \cong \DConf_{m+1}(K_{2m+1})\) 
        \item \(\DConf_{m}(K_{m+1,m+1}) \cong \DConf_{m+2}(K_{m+1, m+1})\)
        \item \(\DConf_{m+2}(K_{m,m+2})\)
    \end{itemize}
    \end{prop}
    If \(m=2\) these align with the known surfaces. However, Abrams showed that \(\DConf_m(K_{2m+1})\) and \(\DConf_m(K_{m+1,m+1})\) are 
    not \(m\)-manifolds for \(m \geq 3\).

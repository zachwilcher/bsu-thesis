    \begin{block}{Proposition (W 2025)}
    If \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) were a connected \(m\)-manifold without boundary,
    then \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) would have to be exactly one of the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause
        \item \(\DConf_{m}(K_{2m+1}) \cong \DConf_{m+1}(K_{2m+1})\) 
        \pause
        \item \(\DConf_{m}(K_{m+1,m+1}) \cong \DConf_{m+2}(K_{m+1, m+1})\)
        \pause
        \item \(\DConf_{m+1}(K_{m,m+2})\)
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \pause
    If \(m=2\) these align with the known surfaces. 
    
    However, \(\DConf_m(K_{2m+1})\) and \(\DConf_m(K_{m+1,m+1})\) are not \(m\)-manifolds for \(m \geq 3\) (\cite{abrams2000configurationspaces})

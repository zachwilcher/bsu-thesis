# An Introduction to Graph Configuration Spaces
By placing n distinguishable particles on a graph and allowing them to move along the edges and vertices without running into each other, the positions of these particles span a topological space known as the ordered graph configuration space.  If the particles are indistinguishable, the resulting space is called the unordered graph configuration space.  In 2000, Aaron Abrams's laid the foundation for studying these spaces in his PhD thesis.  Since then, graph configuration spaces have been applied in fields such as robot motion planning, quantum computation, and geometric group theory.  Much work has been done to understand the homological properties of these spaces.  However, many basic topological questions remain unanswered.  In this talk, we will go through the process of constructing a graph configuration space, discuss how its topology can be related to the underlying graph, and give a brief survey of the applications of these objects.

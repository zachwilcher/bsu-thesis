\section{Definitions and preliminary results}
% These definitions are presented in Abrams on page 10.
Given a topological space \(X\), the \(n\) point (topological) configuration space of \(X\) is
\(\Conf_n(X) = X^n - \Delta\) where \(\Delta\) is the diagonal in \(X^n\).

Treating a graph \(\Gamma\) as a topological space we can construct the
\(n\) point discretized or combinatorial configuration space \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) by 
% this diagonal needs elaboration.
removing a larger diagonal \(\Delta^{\square} = \{(e_1, \ldots, e_n) \mid x_i \cap x_j \neq \emptyset \text{ for some } i \neq j\}\)
from \(\Gamma^n\). Here \((e_1, \cdots, e_n)\) is any \(n\)-tuple of cells in \(\Gamma\).

Abrams showed in \cite{abrams2000configurationspaces} that \(\Conf_n(\Gamma)\) deformation retracts onto \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) and
that \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) is a cubical complex.
He also notes that any point in the
\(n\)-point configuration space is in one-to-one correspondence with a
collection of ``tokens'' placed on the graph. In this project, we will use a slightly different terminology and
and say ``particles'' instead of ``tokens.''

\label{fig:ygraph}
\end{figure}
Imagine \(2\) particles placed on the graph in \ref{fig:ygraph} at \(u_1\) and \(u_2\).  
In the topological configuration space, as the particle at \(u_1\) moves to \(u_3\)
the particle at \(u_2\) is free to simultaneously move to \(u_3\) as well. 
However, both particles would not be able to occupy the vertex \(u_3\) simultaneously.  
Compare this with the combinatorial configuration space, as the
particle at \(u_1\) moves to \(u_3\), the particle at \(u_2\) can not move at
all since the edges \(u_1 u_3\) and \(u_2 u_3\) intersect at \(u_3\) and points
with coordinates belonging to both edges are removed.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node (v1) at (0, 2) {\(v_1\)};
    \node (v2) at (0, 0) {\(v_2\)};
    \draw (v1) -- (v2);
    \node (u1) at (2, 2) {\(u_1\)};
    \node (u2) at (4, 2) {\(u_2\)};
    \node (u3) at (3, 1) {\(u_3\)};
    \node (u4) at (3, 0) {\(u_4\)};

    \draw (u4) -- (u3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{An edge and a \(Y\)-graph}
\label{fig:edgeygraph}
\end{figure}
Now consider the graph in figure \ref{fig:edgeygraph} and put particles at \(v_1\) and \(u_3\).
As the particle at \(v_1\) moves to \(v_2\) there are three ways that the particle at \(u_3\) can move.
Since each way that the particle at \(u_3\) can move can be done simultaneously as the movement of the particle at \(v_1\),
the \(1\)-cell corresponding to the movement of the particle at \(v_1\) to \(v_2\)
borders three distinct \(2\)-cubes (see figure \ref{fig:threepagebook}).
We call this structure a \(3\)-page book.

% It would make so much more sense if we excluded the covers of the book when counting the pages.
% Then, a book with more than 0 pages is not homeomorphic to a surface. 
% However, this would be an annoying substitution in later proofs.
\begin{defn}
    An \(n\)-page book is a collection of \(n\) \(2\)-cubes each glued along a common edge.
    This edge is called the spine of the book.
\end{defn}

Books are common structures found in configuration spaces.
One goal for this project is to determine which configuration spaces are surfaces.

\begin{thm}
A book with more than \(2\) pages is not a surface.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Suppose there exists an \(n\)-page book that is a surface but \(n > 2\).
Let \(p\) be some point in the interior of the book's spine.
% pg. 225 Munkres states that an m-manifold X is a Hausdorff space such that for each point x in 
% X there exists a nehiborhood of x that is homeomorphic to an open subset of R^m.
% Let U be the neihborhood of p in X, V be the open subset of R^2, and \phi
% be the homeomorphism from U to V.
% Take some open disk B centered at \phi(p) in V such that \closure{B} \subseteq V
% restrict \phi to this open disk (this is okay to do in the codomain as \phi is a bijection).
Since the book is homeomorphic to a surface, there exists an open neighborhood \(U\) of \(p\)
which is homeomorphic to an open disk \(B\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
Let \(\phi\) be a homeomorphism from \(\closure{U}\) to \(\closure{B}\) and \(S\) be the portion of book's spine inside of \(U\).
Notice that \(U \setminus S\) consists of \(n\) path components--one from each page of the book.
However,
\[
U\setminus S \cong \phi(U\setminus S) = B \setminus \phi(S).
\]

We claim that \(\phi(S)\) must separate \(B\) into two components.
To see this, first note that \(\phi(S)\) is a properly imbedded arc in \(B\) with \(\Bd(\phi(S))\) consisting of two
points on \(\Bd(B)\).
% homemorphisms map boundary points to boundary points, interior points to interior points, and exterior points to exterior points.
% This is common knowledge but a proof might be necessary TODO.
Since \(\Bd(B)\) is homeomorphic to a circle, there exists two different paths \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) 
connecting these two points together (See Figure \ref{fig:thm:book_1_1}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
        % Define the main circle (the disk D^2) and fill it lightly
        \fill[gray!10] (0,0) circle (2cm);
        \draw (0,0) circle (2cm);
        \node at (0, 2.3) {\(B\)};

        % Define the start and end points of the arc on the boundary of the disk
        \coordinate (P1) at (150:2cm);
        \coordinate (P2) at (-30:2cm);

        \draw[thick, green!50!black] (P1) arc (150:330:2cm);
        \node[green!50!black, below, xshift=-18pt, yshift=5pt] at (240:2cm) {\(\beta\)};
        
        % Label the two regions separated by the arc
        \node at (-0.5, 1) {\(I_{\alpha}\)};
        \node at (0.5, -1) {\(I_{\beta}\)};
        
        % Mark the endpoints on the boundary
        \fill (P1) circle (1.5pt);
        \fill (P2) circle (1.5pt);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{The arc \(\phi(S)\) separates the open disk \(B\) into two components, \(I_{\alpha}\) and \(I_{\beta}\).}
    \label{fig:thm:book_1_1}
\end{figure}

The Jordan curve theorem guarantees that the simple closed curve \(\alpha \cup \phi(S)\) (resp. \(\beta \cup \phi(S)\))
separate \(B \setminus (\alpha \cup \phi(S))\) (resp. \(B \setminus (\beta \cup \phi(S))\)) into a bounded connected component
\(I_{\alpha}\) and an unbounded connected component \(O_{\alpha}\) (resp. \(I_{\beta}\) and \(O_{\beta}\)) when imbedded in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
Notice \(B\setminus \phi(S) = I_{\alpha} \cup I_{\beta}\).
Since \(I_{\alpha} \subseteq O_{\beta}\) and \(I_{\beta} \cap O_{\beta} = \emptyset\),
we have that \(I_{\alpha} \cap I_{\beta} = \emptyset\).
So, \(I_{\alpha}\) and \(I_{\beta}\) form a separation of \(B\setminus \phi(S)\).
\end{proof}

Another common structure found found in graph configuration spaces are \(n\)-cubes.
Consider the graph in Figure \ref{fig:3edges} and imagine \(3\) particles placed at \(u_1\), \(v_1\), and \(w_1\).
Each particle can simultaneously move to \(u_2\), \(v_2\), and \(w_2\) resulting in \(3\)-cube in the configuration space (see Figure \ref{fig:3cube}).

Visually \(n\)-cubes are ``clearly'' not surfaces when \(n > 2\).
However, we can show this formally with an argument using the fundamental group.
\begin{thm}
\(n\)-cubes are not surfaces when \(n > 2\).
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose an \(n\)-cube \(C\) is a surface for some \(n > 2\).
    % imbed C in R^n
    Pick some point \(p\) in the interior of \(C\).
    Since \(C\) is a surface there exists some open ball \(B^n(p, \epsilon)\) in the interior of \(C\) such that 
    it is centered at \(p\) and is homeomorphic to some open neighborhood \(V\) of \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
    Let \(q\) be the point in \(V\) corresponding to \(p\).
    
    % TODO just use the fact that local simple connectedness fails after removing a point in D^2 but doesn't after removing a point in S^2.
\end{proof}

Books and cubes are the meat and potatos of the coming proofs.

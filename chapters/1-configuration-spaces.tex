\chapter{Configuration Spaces}
% These definitions are presented in Abrams on page 10.
Given a topological space \(X\), the \(n\) point (topological) configuration space of \(X\) is
\(\Conf_n(X) = X^n - \Delta\) where \(\Delta\) is the diagonal in \(X^n\).

Treating a graph \(\Gamma\) as a topological space we can construct the
\(n\) point discretized or combinatorial configuration space \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) by 
% this diagonal needs elaboration.
removing a larger diagonal \(\Delta^{\square} = \{(e_1, \ldots, e_n) \mid x_i \cap x_j \neq \emptyset \text{ for some } i \neq j\}\)
from the cubical complex \(\Gamma^n\). Here \((e_1, \cdots, e_n)\) is any \(n\)-tuple of cells in \(\Gamma\).

Abrams in \cite{abrams2000configurationspaces} showed that \(\Conf_n(\Gamma)\) deformation retracts onto \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\).

In \cite{abrams2000configurationspaces} Abrams notes that any point in the
\(n\)-point configuration space is in one-to-one correspondence with a
collection of ``tokens'' placed on the graph. In this project, we will a
slightly ``particles'' placed on the graph instead.  Let \(\Gamma\) be the graph
in \ref{fig:ygraph} and consider \(2\) particles placed on \(\Gamma\) at \(u_1\)
and \(u_2\).  As the particle at \(u_1\) moves to \(u_3\), in the topological
configuration space the particle at \(u_2\) is free to simultaneously move to
\(u_3\) as well. However, both particles would not be able to occupy the vertex
\(u_3\) simultaneously.  In the combinatorial configuration space, as the
particle at \(u_1\) moves to \(u_3\), the particle at \(u_2\) can not move at
all since the edges \(u_1 u_3\) and \(u_2 u_3\) intersect at \(u_3\) and points
with coordinates belonging to both edges are thereby removed.

\end{figure}
Consider the graph in figure \ref{fig:edgeygraph} and put particles at \(v_1\) and \(u_2\).
As the particle at \(v_1\) moves to \(v_2\) there are three ways that the particle at \(u_2\) can move.
Since each way that the particle at \(u_2\) can move can be done simultaneously as the movement of the particle at \(v_1\),
the \(1\)-cell corresponding to the movement of the particle at \(v_1\) to \(v_2\)
borders three distinct \(2\)-cells (see figure \ref{fig:threepagebook}).

% TODO, never say clearly
Clearly \(U\) is not homeomorphic to a surface.
Books are common structures found in configuration spaces.

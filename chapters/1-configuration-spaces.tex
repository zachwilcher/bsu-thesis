\chapter{Configuration Spaces}
Given a topological space \(X\), the \(n\) point configuration space of \(X\) is
\(X^n - \Delta\)
where \(\Delta\) is the diagonal in \(X^n\).
Treating a graph \(\Gamma\) as a topological space we can construct the
\(n\) point discretized or combinatorial configuration space \(\Conf_n(\Gamma)\) by 
removing a larger diagonal \(\Delta^{\square} = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid x_i \cap x_j = \emptyset \text{ for some } i \neq j\}\).

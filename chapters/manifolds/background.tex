\section{Background}
In his thesis \cite{abrams2000configurationspaces}, Abrams asked:
For which \(n\) and \(\Gamma\) is \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) homeomorphic to a closed manifold?
He establishes a partial answer to this question in Corollary 5.8: 
if \(\Gamma\) is a connected graph
without loops and \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) is homeomorphic to a closed
\(n\)-dimensional manifold, then either \(n = 1\) and \(\Gamma\) is a cycle, or
\(n = 2\) and \(\Gamma\) is \(K_5\) or \(K_{3,3}\).

Advised by Peter Haskell, Praphat Fernandes in his undergraduate thesis
demonstrates that if \(\Gamma\) is a simple graph and \(\DConf_2(\Gamma)\)
is a \(2\)-psuedomanifold without boundary the following are true.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(\Gamma\) contains a valence 4 vertex, then \(\Gamma\) is \(K_5\).
    \item If every vertex in \(\Gamma\) has valence 3, then \(\Gamma\) is \(K_{3,3}\).
\end{enumerate}
This recovers Abrams' result about when \(\DConf_2(\Gamma)\) 
is a \(2\)-manifold, as Praphat also shows that
if \(\Gamma\) is simple and \(\DConf_2(\Gamma)\) is a 2-psuedomanifold without boundary,
then the valence of every vertex in \(\Gamma\) is between 3 and 4,
and \(\DConf_2(\Gamma)\) is a 2-manifold. Also advised by Peter Haskell, Molly Ison in \cite{ison2005two} 
extends Fernandes' work in her masters thesis to 2-psuedomanifolds with boundary.

In Example 4.3 in \cite{ko2012characteristics}, it is shown that \(\DConf_3(\Theta_4)\)
is a closed orientable surface of genus 3 by computing its fundamental group and using the
fact that discretized configuration spaces are \(K(\pi, 1)\) spaces.
This result is recovered in \cite{appiah2024algebraicstructurehyperbolicgraph}
with a strictly combinatorial argument.

In correspondance wit Abrams, him and a prior student of his
looked in detail at ``level \(j\)-psuedomanifolds''.
A level \(j\)-psuedomanifold is a CW complex where the interior of every cell of codimension \(k\)
is a manifold point for \(0 \le k \le j\).
With this definition, a level \(n\)-psuedomanifold is a \(n\)-manifold 
and every \(n\)-complex is a level \(0\)-psuedomanifold.
They showed that if \(\Gamma\) is a colored graph then \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) is a level \(2\)-psuedomanifold
if and only if \(\Gamma\) is a ``colored cover'' of \(K_{2n+1}\) or \(K_{n+1, n+1}\).
Moreover, they show that find that there are no level \(3\)-psuedomanifolds of the form \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\)
when \(n > 2\).
It follows there are no \(n\)-manifolds of the form \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) when \(n > 2\).

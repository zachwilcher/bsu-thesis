\section{Exclusivity of Subgraphs}

Now that we have determined the possible subgraphs \(\Gamma - V(M)\) for some \((m-1)\)-matching \(M\),
we claim that if \(\Gamma - V(M_0) \cong \Lambda\) for some \((m-1)\)-matching \(M_0\) and subgraph \(\Lambda\),
then \(\Gamma - V(M) \cong \Lambda\) for any \((m-1)\)-matching \(M\).

\begin{thm}
    Suppose \(\Conf_n(\Gamma)\) is an \(m\)-manifold without boundary for \(m \ge 2\),
    then there exists a subgraph \(\Lambda\) in \(\Gamma\)
    such that \(\Lambda \in \{K_3, K_4, K_3 \cup K_1, K{1,3}\}\)
    and \(\Gamma - V(M) \cong \Lambda\) for any \((m-1)\)-matching \(M\) in \(\Gamma\).
\end{thm}

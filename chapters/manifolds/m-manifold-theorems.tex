\subsection{Theorems}
All the following theorems assume \(m \ge 2\).

\begin{prop}
\(\DConf_m(K_{(m+1), (m+1)})\) is an \(m\)-manifold without boundary.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
\(\DConf_{(m+1)}(K_{(2m+1)})\) is an \(m\)-manifold without boundary.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
If  \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) is an \(m\)-manifold with boundary
and \(\Gamma - (m-1)K_2\) does not contain any cycles,
then \(m = 2\), \(n = 3\) and \(\Gamma = \Theta_4\).
\end{prop}

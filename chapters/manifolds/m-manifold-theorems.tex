\subsection{Theorems}
All the following theorems assume \(m \ge 2\).


Abrams showed the following result in this thesis.
\begin{prop}
If \(m > 2\) then \(\DConf_m(K_{(m+1), (m+1)})\) and \(\DConf_{m}(K_{(2m+1)})\) are not \(m\)-manifolds.
\end{prop}

Applying his duality theorem, it follows that
\(\DConf_{m+1}(K_{m+1, m+1})\) and \(\DConf_{m+1}(K_{2m+1})\)
are not \(m\) manifolds either.

\begin{prop}
If  \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) is an \(m\)-manifold without boundary
and \(\Gamma - (m-1)K_2\) does not contain any cycles,
then \(m = 2\), \(n = 3\) and \(\Gamma = \Theta_4\).
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
If \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) is an \(m\)-manifold without boundary
and \(\Gamma - (m-1)K_2\) contains a cycle,
then \(m = 2\) and \((\Gamma, n)\) is one of the following.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \((K_5, 2)\)
  \item \((K_{3,3}, 2)\)
  \item \((K_5, 3)\)
  \item \((K_{3,3}, 4)\)
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}

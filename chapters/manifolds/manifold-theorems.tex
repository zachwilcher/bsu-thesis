\section{Theorems}

\begin{thm}
  Let \(m \ge 2\). If \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) is an \(m\)-manifold without boundary, 
  then \(\DConf_n(\Gamma)\) is one of the following.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\DConf_m(K_{2m+1}) \cong \DConf_{m+1}(K_{2m+1})\)
  \item \(\DConf_m(K_{m+1, m+1}) \cong \DConf_{m+2}(K_{m+1, m+1})\)
  \item \(\DConf_{m+1}(K_{2m + 1} \cup K_1)\)
  \item \(\DConf_{m+1}(K_{m, m+2})\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(M\) be an \((m-2)\) matching in \(\Gamma\).
  As shown in the previous section, \(\Gamma - N(M)\) is a unique subgraph of \(\Gamma\).
  So, as shown in the previous section there are \(5\) possible \((n - (m-2), \Gamma - N(M))\) pairs.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If \((n - (m - 2), \Gamma - N(M)) = (2, K_5)\), 
    then \(n\) must be \(m\) and 
    by Lemma \ref{lem:complete-graph-is-special}, \(\Gamma\) must be \(K_{2m+1}\).

    \item If \((n - (m - 2), \Gamma - N(M)) = (3, K_5)\), 
    then \(n\) must be \(m + 1\) and
    by Lemma \ref{lem:complete-graph-is-special}, \(\Gamma\) must be \(K_{2m+1}\).

    \item If \((n - (m - 2), \Gamma - N(M)) = (2, K_{3,3})\), 
    then \(n\) must be \(m\) and
    by Lemma \ref{lem:bipartite-graph-is-special}, \(\Gamma\) must be \(K_{m+1, m+1}\).

    \item If \((n - (m - 2), \Gamma - N(M)) = (4, K_{3,3})\), 
    then \(n\) must be \(m + 2\) and
    by Lemma \ref{lem:bipartite-graph-is-special}, \(\Gamma\) must be \(K_{m+1, m+1}\).

    \item If \((n - (m - 2), \Gamma - N(M)) = (3, K_{2,4})\), 
    then \(n\) must be \(m + 1\) and
    by Lemma \ref{lem:bipartite-graph-is-special}, \(\Gamma\) must be \(K_{m, m+2}\).

  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

In \cite{abrams2000configurationspaces}, Abrams showed the following.
\begin{prop}
If \(m > 2\) then \(\DConf_m(K_{(m+1), (m+1)})\) and \(\DConf_{m}(K_{(2m+1)})\) are not \(m\)-manifolds.
\end{prop}
Applying his duality theorem, it follows that
\(\DConf_{m+1}(K_{m+1, m+1})\) and \(\DConf_{m+1}(K_{2m+1})\)
are not \(m\) manifolds either.
